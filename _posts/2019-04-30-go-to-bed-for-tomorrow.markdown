It’s bedtime. Time to go sleep. And you really should go to sleep.

Sleep is how you get rest for tomorrow.

And do you know what could happen tomorrow?

SO MANY THINGS

You might see a friend who’s sad and you’re pretty sure that God planned for you to be there because you have a great idea for how to cheer them up. You might get to do that tomorrow!

Although it could be that tomorrow...

You’ll try a new fruit. You wouldn’t believe how many fruits God created.  Like this one- it’s called Dragon Fruit, but not because dragons eat it. Do you know why they call it that? Me either. Maybe you’ll find out tomorrow!

Or maybe….

You might see a beautiful sunset that makes you forget to breathe for a second and you remember that God is an amazingly talented artist. 

Do you know what else could happen tomorrow?

You could learn a new Bible verse. Like this one:

Now there were also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.                                                                           John 21:25

Wait a second- you just learned it! And it’s not even tomorrow yet.

Speaking of tomorrow...

Maybe it will be a day with those fun puffy clouds and you’ll see one and decide it looks like the shape of a shark eating a butterfly-

WAIT, WHAT? That’s sad! Let’s change that to….

A shark catching a frisbee! (That’s better.) You might see that tomorrow! (In the clouds, probably not in real life...but if you do see that in real life, PLEASE take a picture.)

Or what if tomorrow…

it rains so you stand outside to listen as the water drips all over the trees and grass and it sounds like they’re applauding to thank God for sending the rain?

That could happen to you tomorrow. 

Maybe tomorrow, you’ll have to ride in a car or on a bus and at first it’s boring. But then you remember that God gave you a wonderful imagination and you pretend you’re flying in very, very low plane...or a hot air balloon... Ooh, or a helicopter! (You could make that cool whoomph whoomph noise.)

And if you don’t imagine any of those things, I’m pretty sure you’ll use your imagination somehow tomorrow.

Just think- tomorrow, you might laugh so hard that you get tears in your eyes.

Or you may spin around so fast that you get dizzy. 

Or you could make up a story and tell it to someone. And they ask you to tell it one more time but you forget some parts, so you have to make it up again. And the second story is even better than the first one.

That could happen to you tomorrow.

But for now, it’s time for bed and you know that God’s right there with you, watching over you. And knowing that will probably help you sleep even better. 

So go to sleep and get that rest. 

You’re going to need it tomorrow. There’s so much that could happen.
